# LeetCode
These are the LeetCode problem solutions solved by me. The src folder is subdivided into 3 folders easy , medium and hard. 
These folders contains the solutions to all the easy , medium and hardproblems on leetcode that I have solved till date.
In this , I have followed my own naming convention to sort these.
</br> 
L Type of Problem , Order in which I solved, _ to separate and Problem number on Leetcode.
</br>
After this , somewhere I have written good question for good questions and somewhere I have mentioned the algorithm or question related information.
</br>
**For example** , 
1. LE001_1920 means that it is leetcode easy problem(LE) , I have solved this easy problem the very first (001) ,_ to separate and 
1920 is the leetcode problem number.
</br>
2. LH001_1095GoodQuestion stands for leetcode hard(LH), 001 the very first hard question I tried ,_ for seperator , 1095 is the leetcode question number and good question means it took good efforts from my end to solve this question. So, it is a good question to be retried at the time of revision.
